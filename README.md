# Team-Generator

This challenge I didn't made really well due my family circunstances and my work where I been worked more hours because there are short staff so I couldn't dedicate much time to complete the chanllege and I wasn't focus during the class. I shorted some of this issue during the last few days so from today I can dedicate more time and effort to complete the last failed challenges. 

Thanks of the team for all support and make possible this great course.

I will make best to complete this challenge and following one.
